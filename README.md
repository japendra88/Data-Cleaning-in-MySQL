# Data-Cleaning-in-MySQL
Data cleaning in MySQL involves identifying and correcting (or removing) inaccurate records from a database to improve data quality. Here are several common data cleaning tasks and examples of how to perform them using SQL:

1. Removing Leading/Trailing Spaces:- Use the TRIM function to remove leading and trailing spaces from a column.
2. Standardizing Date Formats:- Ensure all dates follow a specific format by converting and updating them.
3. Replacing Inconsistent Data:- Replace inconsistent data values to ensure uniformity.
4. Handling Null Values:- Identify and handle NULL values, either by filling them with a default value or removing them.
